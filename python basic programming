FIRST PROGRAM
/*PYTHON PROGRAM WHICH ACCEPTS THE RADIUS OF A CIRCLE FROM THE USER AND COMPUTES AREA.*/
>>> from math import pi    //IMPORTS MATH HEADER FILE.
>>> r=float(input("Enter a radius:"))
Enter a radius:1.1
>>> A=(pi*r*r)
>>> print("Area of the circle is",format(A,'.3f'),"sq units.")  //USING FORMAT SPECIFIER UPTO 3 DECIMAL PLACES.
Area of the circle is 3.801 sq units.  //FINAL OUTPUT.


SECOND PROGRAM
/*ACCEPTS A FILENAME FROM USER AND PRINTS THE EXTENSION OF THAT FILE.*/
>>> filename=input("Input the filename:")
Input the filename:abc.py
>>> f_extns=filename.split(".")  //SPLIT() METHOD RETURNS A LIST OF WORDS IN THE STRING/LINE , SEPARATED BY A DELIMITER STRING.
>>> print("The extension of the file is:" + repr(f_extns[-1]))  //REPR-REPRESENTATION, IT SHOULD RETURN A STRING WHICH COULD BE INCLUDED IN AN EXPRESSION.
The extension of the file is:'py'
